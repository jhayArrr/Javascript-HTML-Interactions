# HTML Form and JavaScript Interactions
Verifying Data and Executing JavaScript Through Functions

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

**Purpose**: to create a multiple page website
- A main page will link to all working assignments
- Each child page will have text inputs and radio or checkboxes for test cases (mathematical boundaries to empirically test the data)
- Copy the <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/CS20/tree/master/Websites/Intermediate%20Boilerplate/Basic%20Project%20Folder%20with%20Boilerplate">Basic Project Folder with Boilerplate</a>
- Link index.html to scripts/index.js using debugging line of console.log
  - ```console.log("I made it to childTemplate.js!");```

Steps in Creating an HTML Form (Input & Output) using JavaScript to Processes Information
- Copy the index.html contents to the childTemplate, <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/CS20/blob/master/Websites/Intermediate%20Boilerplate/Basic%20Project%20Folder%20with%20Boilerplate/index.html">Click Here</a>
- Copy the <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/CS20/tree/master/Websites/Intermediate%20Boilerplate/Basic%20Form%20Collection">HTML Form Boilerplate example</a>
  - In this repository, this will be the child_pages/childTemplate.html
  - This template should be all the layout needed for the majority of all the pages
  - Note: in other pages use the parts needed, changing coding, and delete other parts
- Link the child_pages/childTemplate.html to the scripts/childTemplate.js using debugging line of console.log
  - ```console.log("I made it to childTemplate.js!");```
- child_pages/childTemplate.html will be copied to create additional webpages
  - Each link to from .html to .js must be changed
- Use the childTemplate.js to create copies of other .js files for other JavaScript Assignments

Steps in Adding this form to a multiple page website (the example given in this pathway)
- Change the index.html to have navigation to Child Pages, Navigation Menu
  - Remember: pathway due to folders
- Change each Child Page to have navigation to the Script Pages
  - Remember: pathway due to folders here is different (..)
  - Note: open the /child_pages/childTemplate.html and look in the console to the debugging link line
- Copy a childTemplage.html doc and rename to a new doc.html
  - Do the same for childTemplate.js

Steps in Creating HTML Child Pages and JavaScript Pages
- in child_pages copy the childTemplate.html and rename it for each JavaScript Assignment
- in scrips copy the childTemplate.js and rename it for each JavaScript Assignment
- link each .html with it's associated .js file
- link each .html with the index.html

Copy each JavaScript Assignment to each associated .js file

Remember: when connecting HTML Form Data to JavaScript Data, use CSS IDs

# Ideas to Include

How this form will be used in the JavaScript Lessons
- Text inputs will record Variables for the Individual Assignments
- Radio Buttons or Checkboxes will test the Case Study Values

See: https://github.com/QEHS-Websites/JavaScript-Sandbox/tree/master/Form%20HTML%20JavaScript%20Interaction
- Two Number Comparison

Also see: https://github.com/QEHS-Websites/JavaScript-HTML-Interactions

Step through the code with a ReadMe.md file
- What is read first, second
- What happens next in the HTML
- What happens next in the JavaScript
- What happens next back in the HTML

See: https://github.com/QEHS-Websites/JavaScript-HTML-Interactions/edit/master/README.md for ideas

Input Two numbers
Output Largest

JavaScript Output: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_output.asp
- Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
- Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
- Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
- Writing into the browser console, using console.log().

Research
- https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_validation.asp
- https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_validation_number

- Reduce code my writing more functions
- Should include ALERTs cleaner
